Create a file under  /etc/init.d/   with nano or vi and paste the example script below. ex.  sudo vi /etc/init.d/mytestserv
Modify the SERVICE_NAME, PATH_TO_JAR, and choose a PID_PATH_NAME for the file you are going to use to store your service ID.
Write the file and give execution permisions ex. sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/mytestserv
Test that it runs ex. sudo service mytestserv start
Test that it stops ex. sudo service mytestserv stop
Test that it restarts ex. sudo service mytestserv restart


Modify if you need logs
If you need the output log replace the 2
nohup java -jar $PATH_TO_JAR /tmp 2>> /dev/null >> /dev/null &
 
lines for:
nohup java -jar $PATH_TO_JAR >> myService.out 2>&1&


Known Issues
Make sure your jar is not finishing execution by itself.
Use the nohup java -jar Myjar.jar & to verify that it can work as a service.
In Ubuntu use sudo update-rc.d mytestserv defaults if you want to run the service when the SO starts or sudo update-rc.d mytestserv disable to remove from startup.
In Ubuntu 16+ init.d is deprecated, you will get a MyService.service not found there is another tutorial with systemd here
